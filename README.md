- Built-in GUI
- Interactive CLI Wizard
- Docker support
- Configuration Profiles
- MusicBrainz metadata enrichment
- Embedded synchronized lyrics

---

## Installation

```bash
pip install SpotiFLAC
```

---

## Quick Start

SpotiFLAC can be used in multiple ways. Choose the mode that fits your needs.

### GUI Mode (recommended for most users)

Launch the graphical user interface with the `--gui` flag:

```bash
spotiflac --gui
```

*(Or `python launcher.py --gui` if running from source)*

### Interactive Mode (step-by-step wizard)

SpotiFLAC features a smart Interactive Wizard that guides you step-by-step. To launch the wizard, use the `--interactive` flag:

```bash
spotiflac --interactive
```

*(Or `python launcher.py --interactive` if running from source)*

On launch it automatically runs a service health check before asking any questions, so you always know which providers are reachable.

**What the wizard does at startup:**

- **Service Health Check** — probes provider endpoints and shows provider availability inline (✅ / ❌) before asking anything
- **URL History** — shows your last 8 downloads so you can re-run one with a single keypress
- **Folder Memory** — remembers your last output directory and offers it as the default
- **Profile Load** — optionally restores a full saved configuration

**Smart URL Detection:** If you input an Artist URL, it will ask if you want to download "Featuring" tracks. It skips this question for albums or playlists.

**Smart File Paths:** If you input a Single Track URL, it will ask if you want to set a specific `.flac` output path. If you do, it intelligently skips all questions about filename formatting and subfolder organization.

**Unified Quality Profiles:** Automatically translates your desired quality tier across different services (like Tidal and Qobuz).

**CLI Generator:** At the end of the configuration, it generates and prints the exact CLI command for your specific setup, so you can copy and reuse it in your automated scripts.

**Profile Save:** After confirming the download, you can save the entire configuration as a named profile to reuse later.

### Python API (Synchronous)

The classic synchronous API remains the simplest way to integrate SpotiFLAC into your own applications.

```python
from SpotiFLAC import SpotiFLAC

SpotiFLAC(
    url="https://open.spotify.com/track/4cOdK2wGLETKBW3PvgPWqT",
    output_dir="./downloads",
    services=["tidal"],
)
```

This API is fully backwards-compatible with previous releases and is recommended for scripts and applications that do not require asynchronous execution.

### Which API should I use?

| API | Best for |
|---|---|
| `SpotiFLAC` | Scripts, CLI wrappers, automation |
| `AsyncSpotiFLAC` | Discord bots, Telegram bots, FastAPI, asyncio applications |

### Asynchronous API

SpotiFLAC now features a 100% native asynchronous engine, making it ideal for modern Python applications built on asyncio, including:

- Discord bots
- Telegram bots
- FastAPI applications
- Quart / Sanic web servers
- Background workers
- Any asynchronous Python project

The new `AsyncSpotiFLAC` client uses a shared asynchronous HTTP session, allowing multiple downloads and metadata requests to run efficiently without blocking the event loop.

```python
import asyncio
from SpotiFLAC import AsyncSpotiFLAC

async def main():
    async with AsyncSpotiFLAC(
        output_dir="./downloads",
        services=["tidal", "qobuz"],
        quality="LOSSLESS",
    ) as client:

        # Download a single track
        await client.download_track(
            "https://open.spotify.com/track/4cOdK2wGLETKBW3PvgPWqT"
        )

        # Fetch playlist metadata without downloading
        info, tracks = await client.get_playlist(
            "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M"
        )

        print(f"{info['name']} contains {len(tracks)} tracks")

asyncio.run(main())
```

**Why use the async API?**

- Fully non-blocking (asyncio native)
- Shared HTTP connection pooling
- Lower memory usage
- Much better performance when downloading multiple tracks concurrently
- Perfect for long-running applications and web backends

> **Note:** The classic synchronous `SpotiFLAC()` API remains fully supported and backwards-compatible.

---

## JavaScript Extensions

SpotiFLAC supports modular JavaScript extensions originally developed for SpotiFLAC Mobile and now shared across all SpotiFLAC projects.

Extensions can provide alternative implementations for streaming services, allowing SpotiFLAC to continue working even when native APIs change. They are downloaded automatically, kept up to date, and transparently used as fallbacks whenever a native provider fails.

> **Note:** If Node.js is not installed, SpotiFLAC automatically attempts to install it the first time a JavaScript extension is used.
>
> Supported package managers:
> - **Linux:** apt-get, dnf, yum, pacman
> - **macOS:** brew
> - **Windows:** winget, choco

You can also explicitly prioritize an extension:

```bash
spotiflac URL ./out \
  --service ext:tidal-web ext:qobuz-web
```

Extensions use the `ext:` prefix and behave exactly like native providers. They can be mixed freely:

```bash
spotiflac URL ./out \
  --service tidal ext:qobuz-web deezer
```

> **Note:** Automatic fallback to extensions is enabled by default whenever a native provider for
> the same service is installed as an extension. Disable it with `use_extensions_fallback=False`
> (Python) or `--no-extensions-fallback` (CLI) if you want SpotiFLAC to use only the explicitly
> requested providers in `services`/`--service`.

---

## Docker Usage & Headless Automation

A lightweight, CLI-focused Docker image is available for running SpotiFLAC on servers, NAS devices, or any headless environment.

### Build the Image

```bash
docker build -t spotiflac .
```

### Basic Docker Usage

Run a download by mounting local directories to persist your downloads, configuration, cache, and extension registry across container restarts:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -v "$(pwd)/downloads:/app/downloads" \
  -v "$(pwd)/.spotiflac_docker:/root/.spotiflac" \
  -v "$(pwd)/.cache_docker:/root/.cache/spotiflac" \
  spotiflac "https://open.spotify.com/track/4cOdK2wGLETKBW3PvgPWqT" \
  /app/downloads -s deezer -q LOSSLESS
```

### Published Image (GHCR)

Official Docker images are published on GitHub Container Registry (GHCR), allowing you to run the latest version without building locally.

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/bartolomeorusso9/spotiflac-module-version:latest
```

---

## Supported URL Types

SpotiFLAC supports the following URL formats for Spotify, Tidal, Apple Music, SoundCloud, YouTube and Pandora:

| Type | Spotify | Tidal | Apple Music | SoundCloud | YouTube / YT Music | Pandora |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Track | `open.spotify.com/track/...` | `listen.tidal.com/track/...` | `music.apple.com/.../song/...` | `soundcloud.com/artist/track-slug` | `youtube.com/watch?v=...` · `youtu.be/...` | `pandora.com/artist/.../song/TR:...` · `pandora.app.link/...` |
| Album / Set | `open.spotify.com/album/...` | `listen.tidal.com/album/...` | `music.apple.com/.../album/...` | `soundcloud.com/artist/sets/set-slug` | `music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_...` | — |
| Playlist | `open.spotify.com/playlist/...` | `listen.tidal.com/playlist/...` | `music.apple.com/.../playlist/...` | — | `youtube.com/playlist?list=PL...` | — |
| Discography (via artist URL) | `open.spotify.com/artist/...` | `listen.tidal.com/artist/.../discography/albums` | `music.apple.com/.../artist/...` | — | — | — |

> **Note:** SoundCloud and YouTube tracks are downloaded as MP3 (neither platform distributes lossless audio). Apple Music downloads as M4A/ALAC (lossless) or AAC depending on the selected quality. Pandora downloads as MP3 (`mp3_192` by default) or M4A (`aac_64` / `aac_32`). All other services deliver FLAC.
>
> Joox, NetEase, Migu and Kuwo are download-only services — they cannot be used as input URL sources. Use a Spotify or Tidal link and set one of these as the service. These providers are primarily available in select Asian markets and may require a VPN outside those regions.
>
> SoundCloud short links (`on.soundcloud.com/...`) and mobile links (`m.soundcloud.com/...`) are automatically resolved. Tracking parameters (e.g. `?utm_source=...`) are stripped before processing.
>
> Apple Music track links with an `?i=` song parameter (e.g. `music.apple.com/us/album/album-name/id?i=trackid`) are also supported.
>
> Pandora app links (`pandora.app.link/...`) are automatically resolved to their canonical web URL. Pandora pretty URLs (e.g. `pandora.com/artist/artist-name/album-name/song-name/TR:...`) are fully supported.

---

## Advanced Configuration

You can customize the download behavior, prioritize specific streaming services, and organize your files automatically into folders.

```python
from SpotiFLAC import SpotiFLAC

SpotiFLAC(
    url="https://open.spotify.com/album/41MnTivkwTO3UUJ8DrqEJJ",
    output_dir="./MusicLibrary",
    services=["qobuz", "amazon", "tidal"],
    filename_format="{year} - {album}/{track}. {title}",
    use_artist_subfolders=True,
    use_album_subfolders=True,
    loop=60,                     # retry duration in minutes
    track_max_retries=2,         # extra per-track retries on failure
    post_download_action="notify"
)
```

### Service Health Check

SpotiFLAC can probe all provider endpoints before downloading to verify which ones are currently reachable.

In Interactive Mode this runs automatically at startup. In code or scripts you can call it directly:

```python
from SpotiFLAC.core.health_check import (
    run_health_check,
    print_health_report,
    get_working_providers,
)

results = run_health_check(["tidal", "qobuz", "deezer", "soundcloud", "pandora"])
print_health_report(results)

working = get_working_providers(results)
print("Available providers:", working)
```

```bash
# CLI: check all services then download
spotiflac https://open.spotify.com/track/... ./out --service tidal qobuz
```

The health check runs in parallel with a configurable timeout (default: 5 s per endpoint) and never blocks your download if a check fails. In the GUI, the check reports provider-level availability and endpoint counts, without exposing individual raw endpoint URLs.

### Configuration Profiles

Save and reuse complete download configurations without re-typing them every time.

**Save a profile**

```bash
# Save current flags as "hires-tidal"
spotiflac https://... ./out \
  --service tidal \
  --quality HI_RES_LOSSLESS \
  --use-album-subfolders \
  --filename-format "{year} - {album}/{track}. {title}" \
  --save-profile hires-tidal
```

**Load a profile**

```bash
# Load "hires-tidal" — flags override profile values when both are present
spotiflac https://... ./out --profile hires-tidal
```

**In Python**

```python
import asyncio
from SpotiFLAC.core.profiles import (
    save_profile_async,
    get_profile_async,
    list_profiles_async,
)

async def main():
    await save_profile_async("hires-tidal", {
        "services":             ["tidal"],
        "quality":              "HI_RES_LOSSLESS",
        "use_album_subfolders": True,
        "filename_format":      "{year} - {album}/{track}. {title}",
    })

    cfg = await get_profile_async("hires-tidal")
    print(await list_profiles_async())  # ['hires-tidal']

asyncio.run(main())
```

Profiles are stored at `~/.cache/spotiflac/profiles.json`. In the Interactive Wizard, you are prompted to load a profile at startup and optionally save one at the end.

### Batch Downloads

Pass a list of URLs to download them all in sequence. Failed tracks per URL are collected and can be retried with `loop`.

```python
from SpotiFLAC import SpotiFLAC

SpotiFLAC(
    url=[
        "https://open.spotify.com/album/41MnTivkwTO3UUJ8DrqEJJ",
        "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M",
        "https://listen.tidal.com/album/364272512",
    ],
    output_dir="./MusicLibrary",
    services=["tidal", "qobuz"],
    use_album_subfolders=True,
)
```

### Auto-Retry on Failure

Set `track_max_retries` (Python) or `--retries` (CLI) to automatically retry failed tracks. Each retry cycles through all configured providers from the beginning, waiting exponentially longer between attempts (2 s → 4 s → 8 s …, capped at 30 s).

```python
from SpotiFLAC import SpotiFLAC

SpotiFLAC(
    url="https://open.spotify.com/album/...",
    output_dir="./downloads",
    services=["tidal", "qobuz", "deezer"],
    track_max_retries=3,   # up to 3 extra attempts per track
)
```

```bash
spotiflac https://open.spotify.com/album/... ./out \
  --service tidal qobuz deezer \
  --retries 3
```

> **Tip:** Combine `--retries` with `--loop` for maximum resilience — `--retries` handles transient errors on individual tracks, while `--loop` re-queues permanently failed tracks after N minutes.

### Per-Track Timeout

Set `timeout_s` (Python) or `--timeout` (CLI) to cap the time SpotiFLAC will spend downloading a single track. If the download does not complete within the specified number of seconds, the process is terminated and the track is marked as failed — allowing the next provider or retry to take over.

```bash
# CLI — skip any track that takes more than 3 minutes
spotiflac https://open.spotify.com/album/... ./out --service tidal --timeout 180
```

```python
# Python API
from SpotiFLAC import SpotiFLAC
SpotiFLAC(
    url="https://open.spotify.com/album/...",
    output_dir="./downloads",
    services=["tidal", "qobuz"],
    timeout_s=120,
)
```

> **Tip:** Pair `--timeout` with `--retries` so that a stalled track is automatically re-attempted against the next provider instead of blocking the entire queue indefinitely.

### Post-Download Actions

| Action | Description |
|---|---|
| `none` | Do nothing (default) |
| `open_folder` | Open the output folder in the system file manager |
| `notify` | Send an OS desktop notification with a summary |
| `command` | Run a custom shell command — placeholders: `{folder}`, `{succeeded}`, `{failed}` (quote `{folder}` in your template, e.g. `'{folder}'`, to handle spaces; this does not protect against an apostrophe inside the path itself) |

```python
SpotiFLAC(url="...", output_dir="./downloads", post_download_action="open_folder")

SpotiFLAC(url="...", output_dir="./downloads",
          post_download_action="command",
          post_download_command="rsync -av '{folder}/' user@nas:/music/")
```

```bash
spotiflac https://... ./out --post-action notify
spotiflac https://... ./out --post-action command --post-command "rsync -av '{folder}/' user@nas:/music/"
```

> **Note:** Wrap `{folder}` in single quotes in your command template (e.g. `'{folder}'`) to safely handle spaces and most special characters. Single quotes do not protect against an apostrophe (`'`) inside the output path itself — avoid apostrophes in `output_dir`, or escape them manually for your shell before running the command.

### Discography Download

Download the complete discography of an artist. Duplicate tracks (same ISRC across different releases) are automatically skipped.

```python
from SpotiFLAC import SpotiFLAC

# Spotify — albums + singles
SpotiFLAC(url="https://open.spotify.com/artist/1Xyo4u8uXC1ZmMpatF05PJ", output_dir="./MusicLibrary",
          services=["qobuz", "tidal"], use_album_subfolders=True, filename_format="{year} - {album}/{track}. {title}")

# Tidal — full discography (append /discography/albums or /discography/singles to filter)
SpotiFLAC(url="https://listen.tidal.com/artist/7804", output_dir="./MusicLibrary",
          services=["tidal"], use_album_subfolders=True, filename_format="{year} - {album}/{track}. {title}")
```

```bash
spotiflac https://open.spotify.com/artist/... ./MusicLibrary \
  --service tidal --include-featuring \
  --use-album-subfolders --filename-format "{year} - {album}/{track}. {title}"
```

Recommended layout: `--use-album-subfolders` + `--filename-format "{year} - {album}/{track}. {title}"`.

### Custom Output Path (single tracks)

For single track downloads you can specify the exact file path instead of relying on `output_dir` + `filename_format`.

```python
from SpotiFLAC import SpotiFLAC

SpotiFLAC(
    url="https://open.spotify.com/track/4cOdK2wGLETKBW3PvgPWqT",
    output_dir="./downloads",
    output_path="files/song.flac"
)
```

> **Note:** `output_path` is automatically ignored when the URL points to an album, playlist, or artist/discography.

### Qobuz Local API URL (Optional)

SpotiFLAC can use an optional self-hosted Qobuz stream API for improved reliability and reduced rate limits. If you do not provide a local API URL, Qobuz requests are attempted anonymously.

How to deploy your own instance: [github.com/BartolomeoRusso9/qobuz-rest-api](https://github.com/BartolomeoRusso9/qobuz-rest-api)

**How to apply the Qobuz Local API URL in SpotiFLAC:**

- **Interactive Wizard:** The wizard prompts you to enter your local Qobuz API URL during configuration.
- **Environment Variable:**

```bash
export QOBUZ_LOCAL_API_URL="https://localhost:8000"
```

- **Python:**

```python
from SpotiFLAC import SpotiFLAC

SpotiFLAC(
    url="URL",
    output_dir="./downloads",
    qobuz_local_api_url="https://localhost:8000",
)
```

- **`config.json`:**

```json
{
    "qobuz_local_api_url": "https://localhost:8000"
}
```

### Custom Tidal API Instance (Optional)

SpotiFLAC connects to a shared pool of public hifi-api mirrors to fetch Tidal streams. If you want guaranteed availability and full control, you can self-host your own instance and point SpotiFLAC to it — it will always be tried first, before any public mirror.

How to deploy your own instance: [github.com/binimum/hifi-api](https://github.com/binimum/hifi-api)

**Python**

```python
from SpotiFLAC import SpotiFLAC

SpotiFLAC(
    url="https://open.spotify.com/track/4cOdK2wGLETKBW3PvgPWqT",
    output_dir="./downloads",
    services=["tidal"],
    tidal_custom_api="https://your-instance.example.com",
)
```

**CLI**

```bash
spotiflac https://open.spotify.com/track/... ./downloads \
  --service tidal \
  --tidal-api "https://your-instance.example.com"
```

**Interactive Wizard**

The wizard prompts for a custom Tidal API URL at step 12.5, right after the optional tokens section.

**`config.json`**

```json
{
    "tidal_custom_api": "https://your-instance.example.com"
}
```

> **Note:** The custom instance is also saved and restored when using `--save-profile` / `--profile`.

## API Reference

### `SpotiFLAC()` Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `url` | `str` / `list[str]` | Required | A single URL or a list of URLs (batch mode) for Spotify, Tidal, Apple Music, SoundCloud, YouTube or Pandora. |
| `output_dir` | `str` | Required | The destination directory path where the audio files will be saved. |
| `output_path` | `str` | `None` | Exact destination file path for single track downloads. Overrides `output_dir` + `filename_format`. Automatically ignored for albums, playlists and artist discographies. |
| `services` | `list` | `["tidal"]` | Specifies which services to use and their priority order. Choices: `tidal`, `qobuz`, `deezer`, `amazon`, `soundcloud`, `youtube`, `apple`, `pandora`, `joox`, `netease`, `migu`, `kuwo`. Also accepts `ext:<extension-name>` (e.g. `ext:tidal-web`) to use an installed [JavaScript extension](#-javascript-extensions) as a provider; native and `ext:` providers can be freely mixed in the same priority list. |
| `filename_format` | `str` | `"{title} - {artist}"` | Format for naming downloaded files. See placeholders below. |
| `use_track_numbers` | `bool` | `False` | Prefixes the filename with the track number. |
| `use_album_track_numbers` | `bool` | `False` | Uses the track's original album number instead of the download queue position. |
| `use_artist_subfolders` | `bool` | `False` | Automatically organizes downloaded files into subfolders by artist. |
| `use_album_subfolders` | `bool` | `False` | Automatically organizes downloaded files into subfolders by album. |
| `first_artist_only` | `bool` | `False` | Uses only the first artist in tags and filename. |
| `include_featuring` | `bool` | `False` | When downloading an artist discography, also includes tracks where the artist appears as a featured artist. |
| `tidal_custom_api` | `str` | `None` | URL of a self-hosted hifi-api instance. Takes priority over all public mirrors. |
| `timeout_s` | `int` | `None` | Per-track download timeout in seconds. If a single track download does not complete within this time, the process is terminated and the track is marked as failed. SpotiFLAC then moves on to the next provider or retry. Set to `None` (default) to disable the timeout. |
| `loop` | `int` | `None` | Duration in minutes to keep retrying permanently failed tracks after a full session completes. |
| `track_max_retries` | `int` | `0` | Extra download attempts per track when all providers fail on the first try. Each retry cycles through all providers again with exponential backoff (2 s → 4 s → 8 s …, capped at 30 s). |
| `quality` | `str` | `"LOSSLESS"` | Download quality. Tidal: `"DOLBY_ATMOS"`, `"HI_RES_LOSSLESS"`, `"LOSSLESS"`, `"HIGH"`, `"LOW"`. Qobuz: `"6"` (CD), `"7"` (Hi-Res), `"27"` (Hi-Res Max). Apple Music: `"alac"`, `"atmos"`, `"ac3"`, `"aac"`, `"aac-legacy"`. Pandora: `"mp3_192"`, `"aac_64"`, `"aac_32"`. |
| `allow_fallback` | `bool` | `True` | Automatically falls back to the next available quality tier if the requested quality is unavailable. |
| `log_level` | `int` | `logging.WARNING` | Python logging level. |
| `embed_lyrics` | `bool` | `True` | Whether to fetch and embed synchronized lyrics (LRC) into the audio file. |
| `lyrics_providers` | `list` | `["spotify", "apple", "musixmatch", "lrclib", "amazon"]` | Priority order of lyrics providers to attempt. |
| `enrich_metadata` | `bool` | `True` | Enables multi-provider metadata enrichment (HD covers, BPM, labels, etc.). |
| `enrich_providers` | `list` | `["deezer", "apple", "qobuz", "tidal", "soundcloud"]` | Priority order of metadata providers to attempt. |
| `qobuz_local_api_url` | `str` | `None` | Optional local Qobuz stream API URL. When set, the provider uses this endpoint for Qobuz stream requests. |
| `use_extensions_fallback` | `bool` | `True` | Whether to automatically pair a matching installed [JavaScript extension](#-javascript-extensions) as a fallback provider when a native provider fails. Set to `False` to use only the providers explicitly listed in `services`. |
| `post_download_action` | `str` | `"none"` | Action after all downloads finish: `"none"`, `"open_folder"`, `"notify"`, `"command"`. |
| `post_download_command` | `str` | `""` | Shell command to run when `post_download_action="command"`. Supports `{folder}`, `{succeeded}`, `{failed}` placeholders; quote `{folder}` in your template (e.g. `'{folder}'`) since the substituted path may contain spaces. |

### Filename Format Placeholders

## MusicBrainz Enrichment

SpotiFLAC automatically queries MusicBrainz in the background (when an ISRC is available) while the audio is being downloaded, adding professional-grade tags at no extra time cost. Fields written when found:

| Tag | Description |
|---|---|
| `GENRE` | Genre(s), sorted by popularity (up to 5) |
| `BPM` | Beats per minute |
| `LABEL` / `ORGANIZATION` | Record label name |
| `CATALOGNUMBER` | Catalog number |
| `BARCODE` | Release barcode / UPC |
| `ORIGINALDATE` / `ORIGINALYEAR` | First-ever release date |
| `RELEASECOUNTRY` | Country of release |
| `RELEASESTATUS` | Release status (e.g. Official) |
| `RELEASETYPE` | Release type (e.g. Album, Single) |
| `MEDIA` | Media format (e.g. CD, Digital Media) |
| `SCRIPT` | Script of the release text |
| `ARTISTSORT` | Artist sort name for file managers |
| `MUSICBRAINZ_TRACKID` | MusicBrainz recording ID |
| `MUSICBRAINZ_ALBUMID` | MusicBrainz release ID |
| `MUSICBRAINZ_ARTISTID` | MusicBrainz artist ID |
| `MUSICBRAINZ_RELEASEGROUPID` | MusicBrainz release group ID |
| `MUSICBRAINZ_ALBUMARTISTID` | MusicBrainz album artist ID |
| `ALBUMARTISTSORT` | Album artist sort name for file managers |

## Download Validation

After each download, SpotiFLAC validates the file to detect common issues:

- **Preview detection** — if the expected duration is ≥ 60 s but the downloaded file is ≤ 35 s, the file is deleted and the download is retried with the next provider.
- **Duration mismatch** — for tracks longer than 90 s, a deviation greater than 25% (or 15 s minimum) from the expected duration is treated as a corrupt download and the file is removed.
